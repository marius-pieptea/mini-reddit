# React Project - Mini Reddit

This project provides a minimal setup for React to work with Vite, a modern front-end build tool. The setup includes support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules. It also offers two official plugins: one using Babel for Fast Refresh, and another using SWC for the same purpose.
